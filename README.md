Hi, this is a ruby gem to help with math homework for an ODE's class! I've been using a hacky version of this for years and thought I'd clean it up and release it as it might be useful to others.

Next I really want it to be able to figure out convergence. It's an awfully hard task with many ways to do them so I'd be open to suggestions/help. You can see some of my thoughts down below!


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'series'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install series

## Usage

```ruby
require "series"

series = Series.new { |n| Rational(1, 2 * n) }
series[1] #=> (1/2)
series[2] #=> (1/4)
series.partial_sum(5) #=> (137/120)

# You can even provide an upper bound
series = Series.new(upper_bound: 3) { |n| Rational(1, 2 * n) }
series[1] #=> (1/2)
series[2] #=> (1/4)
# Although you can still evaluate the expression at any `n` solving will halt at the bound
series[4] #=> (1/16)
series.first(8) #=> [ (1/2), (1/4), (1/9)]
series.partial_sum(5) #=> (137/120)

# Lower bounds work too!
series = Series.new(lower_bound: 3) { |n| Rational(1, 2 * n) }
series.first #=> (1/9)
```

## Convergence / Divergence

Just finding the result at `n` or the partial sum of `n` isn't all that interesting; finding if a series is convergent or not is.

There are so many possible ways to go about this, but since this is more geared towards students I think the best approach would be to have it run a bunch of convergence tests and be able to say why one worked or failed. To do this though it has to do operations on the expression which requires it to *know* about the expression so I've started another gem called [Nelson](https://github.com/pducks32/nelson) to help write fluent expressions that this library can then manipulate to test for convergence.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
